TODOs:

* Reading of the challenge paper: OK
	* What are the classes?
		- 10 classes
		- Tool shaft, Tool clasper, Tool wrist, Thread, Clamps, Suturing needle, Suction tool, Catheter, Needle Holder
	* Which were the metrics used?
		- mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) 
			- total (over all videos, frames, and classes)
			- by class
			- by video
			- by frame (nao precisa)
		- mean Normalized Surface Dice (mNSD)
			- weighted estimate of the prediction quality by not penalizing false positives close to the target mask
		- segmentation score (SS): sqrt(mIoU * mNSD)
	* Which methods were used?
        - EfficientNetB4 encoder + UNet++ decoder
        - ensemble of a Swin Transformer and a SegFormer
        - LinkNet architecture with ResNet-34 encoder
        - Ensemble of 3 methods:
            - Swin transformer as an encoder and a UperNet as a decoder
            - HRNetV2 as an encoder and an OCRNet as a decoder
            - MiT-B3 encoder and a SegFormer decoder
        - Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) based on the EfficientNetV2-S backbone
        - Swin Transformer Large feature encoder with an UperNet decoder
        - HRNet
        - ...

* Chose model
    - Considering I have very little time, and that my hardware is not very powerful (my GPU is a GTX 1050 Ti, which has 4GB of VRAM), I need a lightweight model that balances speed, accuracy, and efficiency, so that I may have some results in time, and maybe the chance to iterate and do a second training. Heavier methods like HRNet and Swin transformers just won't work, because they need more than 4 Gb of GPU VRAM. And even if I could apply them, the training would take too long.
    - I will start start with MobileNetV3 + UNet Lite for fast results.
